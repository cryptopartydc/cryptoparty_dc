_Code for DC CryptoParty Ethos_
> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

#### Encrypted messenging
##### End-to-end encryption
End-to-end encryption refers to a privacy protocol that only allows data encrypted at the source to be decrypted by the specified recipient, hence content is secure from one end to the other. This works through a process called [public key cryptography](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) or `public key / private key authentication`.

[Signal](https://signal.org/)
1. Let's install Signal on our phones. If you already use Signal, find someone who doesn't and help them find it in their app store, download, and install.
2. It's worth mentioning the importance of disappearing messages. A _New York Times_ reporter compromised several of their sources because their device was seized by law enforcement. Signal stores decrypted messages locally by default.
3. Let's learn how to enable disappearing messages. These messages expire a set amount of time after they have been decrypted and read by the recipient.

**closed source**
1. Facebook Messenger, in the form of secret conversations
2. WhatsApp
3. Google Allo

##### VPNs
A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a trusted, remote server. A VPN forces all outbound and inbound traffic through this end-to-end encrypted tunnel. Someone monitoring your connection activity will only be able to see encrypted traffic between you and the VPN server, not the traffic itself.

**DOs**
- Do research the privacy laws of the country where your VPN is based.
- Do consider the fact some countries can prosecute users for using VPNs within their borders.
- Do be aware some servers will reject connections coming from known VPN locations as malicious.

**DONTs**
- Don't use a free VPN
- Don't assume just because you've paid for a VPN service that the provider does not keep logs of traffic and cannot be compelled to turn over this information to the government or sell it to third parties.
- Don't think VPNs protect you from malicious content on the web.

##### HTTPS Anywhere
`HTTPS Everywhere` is a product of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org). It exists as an extension for Google Chrome and is built into the functionality of the chromium-based, privacy-focused browser, Brave. _HTTPS Anywhere detects unencrypted and attempts to establish an end-to-end encrypted connection with the host_
- [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en)
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/download/)

**Some Cautions**
- Setting up HTTPS to work on a website is not difficult for people with malicious intent.
- Verify web addresses you connect to and ensure you trust the source of the data before entering any sensitive information such as credit card numbers.
- HTTPS prevents third parties from intercepting and interfering with your communication to and from a website. It does not prevent the website from attempting to execute malicious code on your machine or trying to phish your personal information.
