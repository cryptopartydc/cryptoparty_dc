# Code for DC CryptoParty Agenda | December 18, 2018
## Mathematical Magic w/ RSA & WiFi Safaris

**Bring your phone, tablet, computer, or pen/paper to follow along!**

_Code for DC CryptoParty Ethos_
> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

**Remember** to join `#cryptoparty` on [Code for DC's Slack](https://codefordc.org/resources/slack.html).

## WiFi Safaris
_Facilitated by Ed OBrien_
### [WiFi Safari](https://github.com/brangerbriz/wifi-data-safari):
>"WiFi Data Safari is a digital literacy workshop that aims to educate the public about the wireless network data that constantly surrounds them. Participants are lead through an urban environment spotting and collecting wireless signals from nearby personal devices as they travel. Using custom software, participants access personally identifiable data from strangers and perform targeted network attacks against volunteers, in an attempt to better understand the privacy concerns and exploitation tactics associated with WiFi. Throughout the workshop, we have conversations about information privacy and security, the shortcomings of the WiFi protocol, and the ways that companies, governments, and other malicious actors use personal wireless data."

The WiFi Data Safari Workshop is a continuation of the Probe Kit project.

1. Overview of Wifi safari from HOPE conference
2. Review of Probe Requests and Beacon Frames
3. Overview of 'evil twin' attack.
4. Pitch to do a `wifi safari` here in dc - what I've done so far, where I got stuck and could use some help.
5. Breakout to hack on `wifi safari`

## RSA Mathematical Magic
_Facilitated by Boyd Monson_

Boyd will use mathematical magic to facilitate a pen & paper group activity with RSA encryption. Participants will leave with stronger knowledge of the RSA protocol and how it keeps data safe.

## Want to lead a CryptoParty?
Is there a topic in digital security you're particularly interested in? Leading a CryptoParty is a great way to learn more about emerging cryptographic and security concepts. We are looking for folks with all kinds of backgrounds and interests to share their knowledge and interest. Talk to `@csethna` or `@Ed O.` on Slack if you're interested!
