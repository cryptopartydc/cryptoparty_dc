## National Day of Civic Craft Hacking
In honor of Code for America's annual, national event, the [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.codeforamerica.org/national-day-of-civic-hacking), Code for DC will be hosting the [National Day of Civic Crafting](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/events/253072346/).

Come join us and make awesome crafts in the spirit of civic technology. As a Cryptopartier, you can make a tinfoil hat - and proudly discuss the latest trends in digital security with your fellow civic hackers - with the confidence they won't be reading your thoughts any time soon.

If you are a particularly crafty person, please contact co-captain `lizzie_ellis` on [Slack](https://codefordc.slack.com), to propose an activity you'd like to lead.

## Want to lead a CryptoParty?
Is there a topic in digital security you're particularly interested in? Leading a CryptoParty is a great way to learn more about emerging cryptographic and security concepts. We are looking for folks with all kinds of backgrounds and interests to share their knowledge and interest. Talk to `@csethna` or `@Ed O.` on Slack if you're interested!
