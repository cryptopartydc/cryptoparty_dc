_Code for DC CryptoParty Ethos_
Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

**Remember** to join `#cryptoparty` on [Code for DC's Slack](https://codefordc.org/resources/slack.html). If you plan on eating pizza üçï, remember to [RSVP on meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/events/).

## Today's Session
### Special edition: Data Science with Mueller Report

#### Activity
- Use original Mueller report PDF to generate useful data.
- We‚Äôll divide into groups.
- Saving 15-minutes at the end, we‚Äôll do 3-5 minute demos of what we create.
- Group(s) producing a working MVP will be awarded a round of beverages at the post-event happy hour (by me).

#### Tools
- Anything goes, I‚Äôll be using Python, but use whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with.

#### Example project ideas
- OCR the document and generate a word frequency analysis; bonus points for digital visualization
- Use a [Markov process](https://github.com/cryptopartydc/mueller-markovify) to generate ‚ÄúTweets‚Äù based on the report‚Äôs prose; bonus points for machine-generated `#hashtags` or `@mentions`.
- Create a ‚ÄúMuller Report in pictures,‚Äù covering at least 50% of the full report, based on its content; bonus points for targeting a certain audience (e.g. ‚ÄúMuller Report for Kids‚Äù).
- Contribute to the [Enhanced Edition](https://github.com/iandennismiller/mueller-report) of the Muller report with [@edeo](https://github.com/edeo).
- Find where the report absolves the President of wrongdoing; bonus points for announcing your 2020 presidential campaign tonight.

## Want to lead a CryptoParty?
Is there a topic in digital security you're particularly interested in? Leading a CryptoParty is a great way to learn more about emerging cryptographic and security concepts. We are looking for folks with all kinds of backgrounds and interests to share their knowledge and interest. Talk to `@csethna` or `@Ed O.` on Slack if you're interested!
