_an example of how someone could introduce CryptoParty at the beginning of Code for DC project night_

Cryptoparty DC is a learning group for anyone interested in learning about information security in the digital age. We are a community-driven, community-owned learning group. We do not make money or endorse products. But we do talk about digital security hygiene and empower attendees to define their own best practices. This is a great project if youâ€™re new to Code for DC and is open to all people of all technical backgrounds.
