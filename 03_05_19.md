## Circumventing censorship with Tails
**Bring your phone, tablet, computer, or pen/paper to follow along!**

_Code for DC CryptoParty Ethos_
> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

**Remember** to join `#cryptoparty` on [Code for DC's Slack](https://codefordc.org/resources/slack.html). If you plan on eating pizza üçï, remember to [RSVP on meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/events/).

## Today's Session
#### Tails
[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html) is a distribution of linux built on [DebianStable](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable) `(Stretch 9.8)`. Tails is an acronym which stands for "the amnesic incognito live system." Today we'll discuss each component of the acronym as well as how to use Tails.

**Takeaway from today‚Äôs session:**
1. How Tails can help circumvent censorship and surveillance.
2. Understanding of the distinction between a `persistent live OS` and a `full install OS`.
3. Awareness of how to create your own Tails live USB stick.
4. Stomach full of pizza.

#### T.A.I.L.S.
- The
- Amnesic = Tails cannot store any record of your activities on the machine it's occupying. Think "zombie computer."
- Incognito = Tails routes all system traffic through the TOR network. Who's been here before and can explain what TOR is?
- Live System = Tails is a bootable "live" operating system meaning the system state state persists only in memory. Once the computer powers down, it dumps the contents of RAM and the record of your work disappears.

#### Other Linux Distros I think are pretty security conscious but also have offensive capabilities
Not linking directly to them, but here are some lists made by people who agree:

## Want to lead a CryptoParty?
Is there a topic in digital security you're particularly interested in? Leading a CryptoParty is a great way to learn more about emerging cryptographic and security concepts. We are looking for folks with all kinds of backgrounds and interests to share their knowledge and interest. Talk to `@csethna` or `@Ed O.` on Slack if you're interested!
