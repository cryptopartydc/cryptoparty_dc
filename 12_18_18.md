**Bring your phone, tablet, computer, or pen/paper to follow along!**

_Code for DC CryptoParty Ethos_
> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

**Remember** to join `#cryptoparty` on [Code for DC's Slack](https://codefordc.org/resources/slack.html). If you plan on eating pizza üçï, remember to [RSVP on meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/events/).

## Today's Session
Today will be a workshop session. You can participate without an Internet device, but having one will allow you to implement these security practices while we're here to help.

We will walk through **five** easy things we can do to make our digital lives safer and more secure. Steps 1-4 do not require any special software tools other than the devices and services you already own. Time allowing, we will download [Signal](https://signal.org/), so please investigate that tool and feel comfortable with installing the software to your mobile device.

## 1 - Use two-factor authentication on your inbox
_Why?_ Your inbox is a way for an attacker to compromise every single aspect of your life. Not only will they be able to read your emails, they can reset your passwords, access social media, and even your bank accounts.

Two-factor refers to two factors of authentication. A password is one. A single-use code sent to you via SMS or generated by an authenticator app like [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_CA) or [Authy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy) is another. If you don't have one of these apps installed and set up already, that's okay. We can use SMS for now.

Follow these steps to enable 2-factor authentication on your email. It should take about 5 minutes. Please ask us any questions you have about getting it set up or about why we're doing this right now.

## 2 - Encrypt your hard drive
_Why?_ So that unless someone has your password or recovery key, they won't be able to access the data stored on your machine. Both [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption) and [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) have full-disk encryption built-in. Just turn it on.

## Want to lead a CryptoParty?
Is there a topic in digital security you're particularly interested in? Leading a CryptoParty is a great way to learn more about emerging cryptographic and security concepts. We are looking for folks with all kinds of backgrounds and interests to share their knowledge and interest. Talk to `@csethna` or `@Ed O.` on Slack if you're interested!
