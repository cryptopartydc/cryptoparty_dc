> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

#### Passwords
_Passwords are a primary point of vulnerability._
Some general guidelines for creating strong passwords include:
- Passwords shouldnâ€™t relate to personal details.
- Passwords should contain a mix of more than 8 letters and other characters.
- Create strong, random passwords with a `password generator`, like the one found at [http://www.onlinepasswordgenerator.com/](http://www.onlinepasswordgenerator.com/).
- Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms.
Use a password manager to store
