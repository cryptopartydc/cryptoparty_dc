> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

**Remember** to join `#cryptoparty` on [Code for DC's Slack](https://codefordc.org/resources/slack.html).

We are going to fill out this [worksheet together](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fxwiPttSRD6sdKFe7zl0aflFe0uFDWbhpNcu3BseThM/edit). Please remember to **copy** the document to your own Google Drive. Let us know if you need a printed copy to fill out by hand. You can also download it as a [PDF](https://github.com/cryptopartydc/cryptoparty_dc/blob/master/Threat%20Modeling.pdf).

### Definition
A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your assets. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your assets (threats), what they might want from it, and how they might get it (risks). Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against (mitigation) is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis.

### Assets
An asset is something of value to you that you want to keep safe. Some examples of assets include bank accounts, equipment, jewelry, or proprietary information.

### Threats
Threats are the people or entities who may have a vested interest in compromising our assets. It is important to think about who may want to steal your assets and why they might want to do so in order to build an effective model. Understanding threats helps anticipate our risks and manage strategies for mitigation.

### Risks
Risks are the vectors threats will use to compromise our assets.

### Mitigation

## Want to lead a CryptoParty?
Is there a topic in digital security you're particularly interested in? Leading a CryptoParty is a great way to learn more about emerging cryptographic and security concepts. We are looking for folks with all kinds of backgrounds and interests to share their knowledge and interest. Talk to `@csethna` or `@Ed O.` on Slack if you're interested!
