_CryptoParty Ethos_
> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is the border where we draw a line between how far a society can intrude into our personal lives.

You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.
